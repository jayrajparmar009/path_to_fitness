# Path to Fitness

<h2>Backstory</h2>
If you know me personally then you know that I am very passionate about fitness and have devoted significant amount of my time into getting fit over the period of years. During pandemic due to gym closures, I put on some extra kgs and had to undergo a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/body-recomposition">body recomponsition</a> over certain months. I have been collecting data for sometime and got an idea to make it into an interesting data project. So you can find the details for the project below:


<h2>Objective</h2>
Objetive of this product was to get data across various platforms <b>(Data Ingestion Layer)</b> and present it in a manner where I can track it and hold myself accountable. I ended up using <a href="https://https://streamlit.io">Streamlit</a> since it wouldn't be that computationally heavy and I don't plan on scaling it in future. 


This project contains health and fitness data that would be used to create an interface for tracking health on a regular basis

Below are the data sources which would be used for getting data

1. Weighing scale data
2. MyFitness Pal
3. Garmin watch
4. Samsung Health 
5. Orangetheory fitness heart rate workout data


Final Data Product can be viewed on the link below:
