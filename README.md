<h2>ðŸŒŸ Backstory</h2>
<p align="justify"> Fitness has always been a core part of my life. Over the years, Iâ€™ve dedicated significant time and effort toward improving my health and physical performance. However, during the pandemic, with gyms closed, I gained a few extra kilograms and had to undergo a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/body-recomposition">body recomponsition</a> to get back on track.

Throughout this journey, I was consistently collecting personal health data. Eventually, I decided to transform this data into a structured analytics project â€” one that could help me track my fitness metrics and hold myself accountable. This repository documents that project.</p>




<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Objective</h2>
<p align="justify">The primary goal of this project was to <b>aggregate fitness data from multiple platforms (forming a data ingestion layer)</b> and present it in an easy-to-use dashboard for personal tracking and accountability.

I chose <a href="https://https://streamlit.io">Streamlit</a> to build the interface because it is lightweight, interactive, and well-suited for personal projects that donâ€™t require heavy computational resources or large-scale deployment.</p> 



<h2>ðŸ—‚ Data Sources</h2>
<p align="justify">Data aggregated from four different platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Weighing Scale</b>: Bioimpedance-based metrics (weight, body fat, water %)</li>
  <li><b>MyFitnessPal</b>: Calorie and macronutrient tracking</li>
  <li><b>Garmin Watch</b>: Activity, heart rate, and workout tracking</li>
  <li><b>Samsung Health</b>: Supplementary health metrics</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Some APIs (e.g., Garmin) allow automation, while others (e.g., weighing scale) require manual export due to limited API availability.

<h2>ðŸ§  Project Design & Architecture</h2>

<h3>Key Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Focused on <b>trend tracking</b> vs. absolute accuracy</li>
  <li>Modular scripts for each data source</li>
  <li>Master dataset stored in <b>AWS S3</b> and consumed by Streamlit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Flow</h3>
